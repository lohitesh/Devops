# A Persistent Volume is a piece of storage in your cluster that Kubernetes can use like a hard drive.
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: html-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /tmp/html-data

# above code will use path /tmp/html-data on local host
# This says: "Hey Kubernetes, here's a 1GB storage space available for use."

# A Persistent Volume Claim is a request by a user (or a Pod) for storage. It asks for a certain amount (e.g., 1GB) and access type (read/write).

# This says: "I need 1GB of space that I can write to. Please find a matching volume."
# 👉 Kubernetes automatically finds a suitable PV that matches the PVC and binds them.

# ReadWriteOnce (RWO) : One node can read and write. 🚫 Can't be used by multiple nodes at the same time
# ReadOnlyMany (ROX) : ✅ Multiple nodes can read 🚫 None can write
# ReadWriteMany (RWX): ✅ Multiple nodes can read and write ❗ Not supported by all volume types
